## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
In this project, I only used the article provided to construct the project.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
When working on this project, I encountered many problems. I have nevr worked on web development ever and this was my first expierenced. Seeing the end result was wholesome but the 
journey was quite difficult. I had problems with the buttons lighting up. I fixed the error by simply looking at the code and determing the logic. I had the 1st button light 
up but not the others, so I had to really look and determine my problem. Another one of my problems was that I have little exxpiernce on web development. So, I had to read many
articles and watch many tutorials to unerstand what the code was doing. I couldn't much new features due to my current level , but I still learned how to observe
and write code for web development.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This was the first time I tried web development and may I say, I was very amazed. In the future, I want to learn more about this language and way of constructing programs.
I was very amused by the sounds and color implementation, and I want to learn in more detail how it is that it's implemented. I want to see how web development is used for different 
projects, arnging from simple games to full working applications. My submission, left me amused about the different level of opportunities their is in web development. I hope to
learn more and be more adjusted to using web development on projects.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If given the opportunity to work more on this project, I would like to add more features and refactor certain features. Unfortunatley, due to time I couldn't implement everything I 
wanted but I have ideas to make this project better. I would like to speed the timer and have a random pattern show. Having differnt outcomes is very good because it avoids
the user from being stuck to one version of this playing this game. I'd also want to add more buttons that add to the complexity, have more sounds and colors would make 
the game intresting. Overall, I have a good setup and by implementing features, the game would be fun for user to play.
